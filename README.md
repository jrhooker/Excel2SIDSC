Save your Excel file as 2003 Excel XML.

Copy one of the bat files in the batch folder. Edit the parameters at the top of the page to point to the location of the Excel XML file.

Run the bat file and see what you get. Might be nice, might be awful. Excel is a less than ideal way of storing something as precise as register data.
